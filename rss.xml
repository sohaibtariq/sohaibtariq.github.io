and makes an API call to one of our microservices.
Naturally, this calls for an error handling mechanism, considering that the microservice
could be down or unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda provides its own retry mechanism where a message is picked up from the queue by the Lambda
consumer and becomes invisible to other consumers for a specific duration called the &lt;em&gt;visibility timeout&lt;/em&gt;.
If the consumer completes execution successfully, it automatically deletes the message from the queue.
In case of unsuccesful execution (such as a Runtime Exception), the &lt;em&gt;approximate receive count&lt;/em&gt;
of the message is incremented and it becomes available to other consumers after the &lt;em&gt;visibility timeout&lt;/em&gt; passes.
The number of times a message can be re-read from the queue
before it is finally sent to a Dead Letter Queue(DLQ) is configured in the Redrive policy of the
SQS Queue and is tracked via the &lt;em&gt;approximate receive count&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retry mechanism was not exactly what I had in mind for our use case. I was thinking along the
lines of a backoff strategy that keeps retrying the API call with exponentially increasing wait time;
finally sending the message to a DLQ after a set number of retries. This would give us ample time to
fix any issues with our miscroservice and prevent it from being bombarded with failing API calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I ended up with: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a very basic Java function to calculate the exponential wait time, given the number of
retries &lt;strong&gt;recvCount&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;        int randomInt = rand.nextInt(60);
        Long result = new Double(Math.pow(2, recvCount)).longValue() + 30 +randomInt;  //adding jitter to new random visibility timeout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the addition of &lt;strong&gt;randomInt&lt;/strong&gt;. That is &apos;jitter&apos;. A bit of randomness. I read about it in some
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/exponential-backoff&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; by Google Cloud and included
it as a good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, set the visibility timeout of the message to the value that we just calculated above. The maximum value allowed by AWS is 43200 seconds
or 12 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;  sqs.changeMessageVisibility(queueUrl, msg.getReceiptHandle(), newVisibilityTimeout.intValue());&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we check the response to our API call. If it is a 400 or 500 series response, we throw a Runtime Exception and change the visibility timeout of the
message. This is
the easiest way I could come up with to signal unsuccessful execution of the Lambda function. Plus, we can only throw unchecked exceptions
in our handler method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;...
// api call
...  
 if (response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() &amp;gt;= 400){
                            new ExponentialBackoff().setVisibilityTimeout(msg);
                            throw new RuntimeException(&amp;quot;Request to server failed&amp;quot;);
                        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExponentialBackoff is my utility class where the code that calculates and sets the visibility timeout lives. It also has some other
utility functions that are not essential for this demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it; A bare bones exponential backoff implementation for AWS Lambda. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
