I was thinking along the\nlines of a backoff strategy that keeps retrying the API call with exponentially increasing wait time;\nfinally sending the message to a DLQ after a set number of retries. This would give us ample time to\nfix any issues with our miscroservice and prevent it from being bombarded with failing API calls. </p>\n<p>This is what I ended up with: </p>\n<p>First, a very basic Java function to calculate the exponential wait time, given the number of\nretries <strong>recvCount</strong>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">        int randomInt = rand.nextInt(60);\n        Long result = new Double(Math.pow(2, recvCount)).longValue() + 30 +randomInt;  //adding jitter to new random visibility timeout</code></pre></div>\n<p>Notice the addition of <strong>randomInt</strong>. That is 'jitter'. A bit of randomness. I read about it in some\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/exponential-backoff\">documentation</a> by Google Cloud and included\nit as a good practice.</p>\n<p>Next up, set the visibility timeout of the message to the value that we just calculated above. The maximum value allowed by AWS is 43200 seconds\nor 12 hours. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  sqs.changeMessageVisibility(queueUrl, msg.getReceiptHandle(), newVisibilityTimeout.intValue());</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, we check the response to our API call. If it is a 400 or 500 series response, we throw a Runtime Exception and change the visibility timeout of the\nmessage. This is\nthe easiest way I could come up with to signal unsuccessful execution of the Lambda function. Plus, we can only throw unchecked exceptions\nin our handler method.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">...\n// api call\n...  \n if (response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() &gt;= 400){\n                            new ExponentialBackoff().setVisibilityTimeout(msg);\n                            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Request to server failed&quot;);\n                        }</code></pre></div>\n<p>ExponentialBackoff is my utility class where the code that calculates and sets the visibility timeout lives. It also has some other\nutility functions that are not essential for this demonstration.</p>\n<p>There you have it; A bare bones exponential backoff implementation for AWS Lambda. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Exponential backoff for AWS Lambda","date":"August 19, 2019","description":"A very basic Java implementation of exponential backoff for AWS Lambda"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/exponential-backoff/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/java-dontnet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Professional Journey as a Software Engineer"}}}}}
